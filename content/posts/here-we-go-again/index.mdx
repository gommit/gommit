I recently developed the urge to start blogging again. I’m at a place in my life where a lot of things have changed and in the past, it just helped me to stay on an even keel by writing through it.
I used to write much more. I did so on home-built CMS systems and blog platforms that have since been archived in the digital landfill of wiped hard drives. Everything I ever make ends up there. It’s fascinating.

But of course, before I start writing, I had to build my own blogging platform. It’s becoming less and less work as laziness drives people to innovate and simplify the mind-numbingly boring parts of inventing your own programming language to blast some characters onto the web. I’m writing this on my new toy called Bubble.io. It’s one of those shiny new no-code platforms that can be extremely dangerous in the hands of people like me. Jack of all trades but master of none.

If this post turns out ok, I might just update my DNS records and bid Tumblr farewell. Thanks for all the fish.
It also means that you can watch in real-time while I cobble this thing together. It’s going to be more exciting than watching paint dry, I promise (this is usually how it starts. High ambitions but then no delivery).
